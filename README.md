    * Windows — ```exe``` file
  * Once the installation process is finished, the JDK should now reside in ```/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/```
  * Type the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME={INSERT_PATH_TO_JDK_HERE} # e.g. /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-{version}.jdk/Contents/Home

   export PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

 * Type ```mvn --version``` in the terminal to make sure Maven is now installed
